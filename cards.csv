During this exercise, you will observe the work of your consciousness, imagining that it is a white room through which thoughts pass.  You can perform it in any quiet place, sitting or lying down.  Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.  Breathe slowly and evenly throughout the exercise.,"So you're feeling anxious, maybe you're shaking. What can be done to make it easier:

 You can do more - the more the better, but not less than 10!  Yes, everyone will have them - no matter how unhappy you live

 It can be both important and large-scale events for you, and all sorts of little things.

 For example:
 1. I ate a very tasty piece of cherry pie.
 2. I finally finished the assignment I've been putting off all week.
 3. I saw a very beautiful sunset
 4. I bought what I had long dreamed of
 5. Hugged a person I like
 6. Promoted at work
 7. Watched an interesting series of something
 8. Someone praised me for something or what I did (this is what you need to write out directly)
 etc.

 In general, the more detailed you describe these moments, the better.  But you can limit yourself to what is simply listed in such a short form
","In order to help yourself in the most difficult moment, you can refer to the biography of Viktor Frankl. Viktor Frankl - Austrian psychologist and physician of Jewish origin

 During the Second World War, Frankl was probably in the most terrible situation you can get into - he ended up in a concentration camp, and his wife and parents also died during their stay in concentration camps

 Can you imagine a worse situation?",The following exercises will help you become less irritable and integrate a nonjudgmental attitude towards others and yourself into your life!,I-statement (I-message) is a psychological term denoting a person’s statement in which he describes his feelings and formulates his wishes based on his own thoughts and emotions, trying not to offend or blame others for this.  This practice really helps to express emotions and find mutual understanding. Try to compose a message to the one you are angry with, in the following form: ,"So now you are angry.  First you need to reduce the intensity of experiences in order to think more clearly.  Preferably quickly, before the anger turns into something destructive.  To do this, you need to influence the body and activate the parasympathetic nervous system - the one that is responsible for relaxation.
 What to do:
 Lean forward.  Bend over as if you want to touch your toes.  You can do this while standing, you can sit with your head between your knees.  Take a few deep and slow breaths in and out.
 Breathe in rhythm.  Lengthen your exhalation - this is the easiest way to activate the parasympathetic nervous system.  Count mentally as you breathe: if the inhale is for 4 counts, the exhale should be at least 5. You can combine rhythmic breathing with a forward bend.","The first step in dealing with shame is to identify what makes you feel it.  Try to remember situations in which you feel uncomfortable.  What kind of feelings does the phrase “you should be ashamed of” hurt?

 If it seems to you that the complexes are rooted in childhood, and this happens very often, try to look at yourself as a child through the eyes of yourself as an adult.  Why were you ashamed then?  Was it justified?  What could guide those who did so?  Write or tell a person you trust about it, try to figure out how that experience affects you today.

 Identify your ""weak points"" - shame always ""finds"" our most vulnerable spots and puts pressure on them.  A young mother who is not confident in her own abilities will feel this way when someone criticizes her parenting style (in fact, she just doubts herself);  an elderly person can be vulnerable under the pressure of a young colleague who will note any, even a minor flaw (fear of being insolvent).",The surest way to get rid of guilt is to admit that you did something wrong, ask for forgiveness from all those affected and try to eliminate the consequences.  Susan Whitburn, a professor at the University of Massachusetts who studies guilt, proposes such an algorithm.
 Imagine that you are in a medium-sized white room with two doors.  Thoughts enter through one door and leave through another.  As soon as a thought appears, concentrate on it and try to categorize it as evaluative or non-evaluative (Example of an evaluative thought: “I will look stupid at tomorrow’s performance, they will laugh at me” / Example of a non-judgmental one: “I am afraid of tomorrow’s performance, how can I  anxious .. ”note by the author of the channel),Try to adjust your breathing (probably you are holding it from anxiety, pay attention), try to breathe deeply for 30-40 seconds, at a pace that is comfortable for you, but evenly,"Tell a close one (or several people) about the situation, ask for support.

 It is important to do this as soon as possible after the incident before you go to bed.
 If there is no opportunity to share with loved ones, it can be any other people who will not devalue the problem and will take your side",Among those people who seem inspiring to you, find 5 who began to achieve success at an older age than you are now.," The next day, open the same notebook or note and repeat - write down what you liked during the day 

 Try to hold out for a week, doing this reflection every day, it is advisable to form it as a habit","In the unbearable conditions of the concentration camp, not many managed to survive - if a person did not die there from numerous diseases and beatings, he often resorted to suicide

 Victor had nothing to lose and nothing to live for - he felt completely helpless in this situation and thought that he could not influence it in any way",Practice reading the news without unequivocally judging any of the behaviors described.  Take a stand (even if you don't believe it) for each character, highlighting the highest good based on that person's awareness.,"Fact.  Initially, the factual side of the event, that is, what happened, is described without judgment, as accurately and concretely as possible.  Usually such a statement begins with the word ""when"".","You have reduced the intensity of your anger, but this is a temporary solution.  If nothing else is changed, the anger will soon return.  So the next task is to examine your anger.  Just saying ""I'm angry"" is not enough.  To manage emotions, you need to accurately name them.  And for this - to understand their shades and causes.
 What to do:
 Ask yourself a few important questions, verbally or in writing.  If you do this regularly, the ability to be aware of your feelings will increase.
 What made you angry?  Just describe the situation without trying to analyze it.
 What did you think when all this happened?  Describe your interpretation of the situation.  Do you notice hasty conclusions, assumptions, other cognitive distortions in it?
 What was your bodily reaction to the situation?  Have you noticed tension or stiffness in some parts of your body?  What happened to your breathing and pulse?
 What was your body doing?  Describe his language: posture, facial expression, movements.
 What did you like to do?  Maybe shouting, throwing things or not making eye contact?  Why did you want this?
 What did you do?  Did you follow the impulse, or did you do something else?
 What is the best way to identify the emotion you are experiencing?  You can make a complex definition of a dozen words.  You can peep suitable ones in the Dictionary of Aesthetic Emotions.  Or use neologisms, as Lisa Barrett advises (she defines the disappointment and guilt over eating chips as ""no chips"").","Try noticing what hurts you, and then ask yourself, “Why does this hurt me so much?  How can I prove to myself (not to anyone else, but to myself!) that there is no reason to be ashamed?  And what emotion should I feel instead of him?  Fear?  Anger?  Or even joy?  Allow yourself these feelings.  It may be difficult at first.

 Open any list of emotions - and check which one you are uncomfortable showing, and therefore you replace it with shame.

 By the way, do not forget that shame is also an emotion, and, oddly enough, you should not be ashamed of it either - after all, you are not to blame for the fact that it is inherent in you.",Don't try to suppress your guilt.  Research shows that this leads to an increase in negative emotions.  It's better to admit to yourself that you feel guilty.  This will help you get your emotions under control.,,,,
Consider each thought carefully, with curiosity and compassion until it goes away.  Don't try to analyze it, just note if it's evaluative or not.  Don't challenge it, don't try to believe or disbelieve in it.  Just be aware that this is a thought, a brief moment of your brain activity, an occasional visitor to your white room.," ""Hands-lashes"".  Try to make the body ""rubber"" as much as possible by bending over, lowering and relaxing your arms, neck, and torso.  Find the most comfortable position and swing","try to find communities on the Internet, forums of people who are faced with a similar situation, share (you can anonymously), ask for support.

 If you are faced with a traumatic situation, it is especially important to seek help from a specialist as soon as possible.}",For example, until his 35 years, Harrison Ford was considered an unsuccessful actor, abandoned his career and worked as a carpenter.  J. K. Rowling wrote her first successful novel at 40, and Charles Bukowski did not begin to fulfill himself as a writer until 50. Of course, there are examples of later self-realization.,"At the end of the week, return to the list that you got, reread and underline the most significant points for you with a dotted line

 For example, you can emphasize things related to your actual psychological task - if you are trying to beat procrastination, emphasize those points that are related to the fact that you did something / finally took up something

 Think about how many wonderful things are happening in your week - although many of these may be small things, they bring you pleasure!","His own state subjected millions of people to inhuman tortures, murders, the world turned out to be mortally unsafe for him and many others simply because they have such a national origin

 However, Frankl survived.  Survived by finding the meaning of life even in such a disgusting situation

 He realized that in spite of everything, he can influence what is happening, at least not in a global sense, but at least where he is, that he can save the lives of at least the rest of the prisoners","Seeing a careless driver / scooter / cyclist who does not follow the rules
 traffic, accept his behavior without judgment.  The way he drives is a direct reflection of his needs at the moment of awareness of them.  A speeding teenager is more willing to show off in front of his girlfriend, or act out his anger, or show his masculinity, than to drive safely.  As he loses faith in his young man's reflexes and becomes more aware of danger and his own mortality, his driving style will change."," The senses.  At this stage, the speaker calls the interlocutor his feelings and emotions that he experienced in connection with the fact that happened (for example, “I felt"" or “I liked / did not like”).","As long as you consider anger to be a negative emotion that always destroys, you suppress it, otherwise you yourself will seem spoiled and feel guilty.  But remember: getting angry is bad only when you do not control this process.  And management problems begin with the suppression of emotion.  So the new task is to remove the taboo from anger.
 What to do:
 Think back to when and how you learned not to be angry.  Who told you about this?  What do you remember when you think that anger only destroys everything?  Check: are you confusing emotion (anger) and behavior (shouting)?  Think of and write down a few statements that give you the right to be angry.  For example: “Now I am angry, and this is normal.  My anger makes sense because [description of the situation].”  Beliefs about the taboo of emotions are usually deeply rooted in our self-talk, which happens automatically, and it takes practice to think differently about anger.  Repeat the exercise over and over again in moments of anger and reread what you wrote once or twice a day.","The next aspect is communication.  Remember that you are struggling in part with the fear of being alone and isolated.  Build connections, create a community of people you trust, who are ready to listen to you and accept you the way you are.  And also become someone you can trust.

 By starting a conversation about shame and identifying the problem, we have already taken the first step towards solving it.  Sympathy and empathy - that's what you need to learn, these are two antidotes for unreasonable pangs of conscience.","Remember exactly what you did.  It will be unpleasant - most likely, the feeling of guilt will increase for a while.  Despite this, try to approach the task as responsibly as possible - remember as many details as possible.

 Don't try to justify yourself.  Instead, think about whether you were trying to satisfy some of your needs by making a mistake.  This will help you correct your behavior in the future and prevent the mistake from happening again.

 Let's say you feel guilty because you yelled at your partner for no reason.  But not because they wanted to treat him cruelly.  And because of the fact that lately he began to move away and it scares you.  Therefore, in order to no longer make baseless scandals, you need to discuss the relationship with your partner.",,,
Beware of thoughts that you have classified as evaluative.  They will try to take possession of you, to force you to accept the assessment.  The point of this exercise is to notice how “sticky” judgmental thoughts are—how they get stuck in your mind and how difficult it is to get rid of them.  You will determine that a thought is painful and judgmental by how long it stays in the white room, or by whether you begin to feel any emotion about it.," 4. The second most  important stage.  Slowly straighten up and shake well (when anxious, our body mobilizes and the body shakes. Tension. Usually people try to avoid this tremolo and cope with it. On the contrary, I propose to succumb to it and even strengthen it, give the body what it wants

 So you can feel more relaxed and calm in order to continue to cope with stress with your “head” 

 If it is not possible to complete this entire cycle, do one thing - what is most convenient now}",,"Study their biographies - see what difficulties they had to face in life, how they overcame them.

 What do you have in common?  What should be learned from them?  Doesn't this mean that, perhaps, everything is ahead of you?"," Try to build your own system for re-reading these entries - you can re-read every month and underline the most significant with a solid line, you can underline with a thick line every season, etc.

 When you constantly record these things and periodically return to this list, rereading it and highlighting the main thing, you are guaranteed to feel better.","In the concentration camp, he, as a doctor (although he himself was in poor physical and emotional condition), began to help other prisoners not to die from various diseases.

 Frankl's fascination with psychology and philosophy led to the fact that he essentially created a psychological support group right there, and helped the rest of the prisoners (many of whom wanted to commit suicide) find the meaning of life, hold on, feel not completely helpless, able to influence what is happening",When you see people in unattractive clothes or with sloppy hair or whose appearance is not to your taste, practice this mantra: they are flawless in any choice that creates their appearance, think about the fact that everyone chooses how they look, that the taste for appearance is very  subjective thing.,Explanation.  The speaker names and explains the reasons for which this feeling arose.  Such a statement usually contains such turns of speech as: “because”, “due to the fact that”, etc.,"Anger feeds on itself: it encourages you to do exactly what supports its flame or even makes it flare up.  The paradoxical way to deal with him is to do the opposite of what he wants.
 What to do:
 When you get angry, think about what you want to do and do exactly the opposite.  Let's say you had a fight with your partner and you want to say something hurtful to him.  Say you love him.  If this is inappropriate or it’s not possible to say love sincerely now, retire to another room and do not talk with your partner until the desire to continue the quarrel passes.  Do not continue to think badly about your partner, as anger dictates, but think with kindness.  Or switch to an activity that will occupy your thoughts.","Shame acts in such a way that a person feels unworthy of receiving kindness and support: the “impostor syndrome” turns on, and it begins to seem to him that he does not deserve love.
 Believe me, it's not.  If someone wants to show you good feelings - do not interfere, allow yourself not to reject his words.

 And at the same time, remove from your environment people who provoke shame in you.  It seems that in Russian there is still no equivalent to the word shamer, although it is in Russia that every passer-by can become such a “shamer”.  If you see these traits in people you know, try to interact less with them;  if this is a partner or parents, discuss the problem.  Ask: “Why are you embarrassing me for this?  How do you feel when you say that?

 Perhaps they, too, are simply not able to express their emotions.  Or they are scared.  Or they are surprised by your actions, and they try to suppress you.  In especially severe cases, when a toxic relationship causes more and more overwhelming shame, when someone uses it to manipulate or hurt you, it may be better to end it altogether.

 And of course, it is necessary to show ""self-compassion"": feeling shame, it is difficult to treat yourself well, you want to hide in a corner and punish yourself even more.","Sincerely ask for forgiveness from those you offended.  Be sure to tell them that you understand how much pain and inconvenience they have caused and that you are sincerely sorry for it.  To demonstrate to a person that you fully understand what exactly you are guilty of in front of him, use the “I-statement”.  For example: ""I'm sorry about what I did.""

 And try to avoid phrases like, ""I'm sorry you're hurt.""  They show that although you regret that the other person is experiencing unpleasant emotions, you do not seem to see anything wrong with your behavior.",,,,,,
 Try to constantly maintain even breathing, keep a clear image of the room and doors, follow thoughts and classify them.  Remember that a thought is just a thought.  You are much bigger than her.  You are the one who creates the white room through which thoughts are allowed to pass.  You have a million of them, they leave, but you still remain.  Thought does not require any action from you.  A thought does not oblige you to believe in it.  Thought is not you.,,,, 5. If you feel resilient enough or don't like to write down, try just remembering these 10 things every night before bed, curling your fingers, but this is less effective,"Thus, Frankl himself cheered up - he felt useful, understood why he lives, felt that there is free will even where it is very difficult to find it.

  On April 27, 1945, Frankl was liberated by American troops.
  When he returned to freedom, he became one of the greatest psychologists in the history of mankind, created his own direction - Logotherapy, aimed at finding the meaning of the client's life and, due to this, leading to an improvement in the psychological state.

Imagine for a moment what really pisses you off about it.  Now take a stand where his/her beliefs, values ​​and actions are the only ones possible given the limitations of his/her awareness and ambition at this time (does not work with a tyrant politician who does terrible things).,"A wish.  The speaker offers the desired scenario for the development of the situation: ""I want.""","Water is liquid, solid and gaseous.  And the mind is rational, emotional and wise.  The rational state operates with logic and facts.  Anger is meaningless, we suppress it and do not feel it.  The emotional mind, on the contrary, gives free rein to feelings and blocks access to reasoning.  We lose control and scream.  In a wise state, the mind is balanced: it sees emotions and is able to reason.  We get angry and want to scream, notice it, and decide not to.  It is this reaction that is needed for anger to stop being destructive.
 What to do:
 Imagine a person who embodies the idea of ​​wisdom.  Perhaps this is your friend, maybe a famous person or a literary character.  Close your eyes and imagine what he would say to you if you told him about your problem.  Sit like this for a couple of minutes, listening to his words and tone of voice.  Live the experiences they evoke.  Do this exercise even if there is no anger to learn how to consciously turn on a wise state of mind.  Just imagine a hypothetical situation that would make you angry first.","But imagine that in your place now is another person, the one you appreciate and love.  Would you shame him in this situation?  How would you comfort him, how would you help?  And then transfer that behavior to your personality.
 Tamar Chansky, author of Break Free from Anxiety, suggests choosing four people—dead or alive, real or imagined—who can show you empathy.  Now ask yourself, how would they view your situation?  Maybe you look better in their eyes than in your own?

 Practice forgiveness.  Whatever shortcomings you find in yourself and in your own behavior, everyone has every right to forgive himself for them.

 Shame should not prevent you from living, even if others really want it.  Allow yourself to be imperfect, to try, to make mistakes and correct them - and do not let others criticize you for it.

 And yes, don't be ashamed of yourself either.","Back up remorse with action.  If the damage from your actions is material, compensate for it.  If psychological, start behaving differently with the injured person.  And if for some reason you cannot directly do something for the victim, help someone else.

 For example, send a donation to a charitable foundation.  “Atonement by action is not punishment.  This is a reparation that the guilty must pay if they want to alleviate the feeling of guilt, ”explains Susan Whitbourne.",,,,,
 Just watch them walk through the white room.  Let them live their short life and tell yourself that they have a right to exist, even estimated ones.,,, What do you have in common?  What should be learned from them?  Doesn't this mean that, perhaps, everything is ahead of you?," If you managed to perform this technique for a month, go to the next step - try to catch at least once a day (maybe more) the moment that you would potentially put on this list in the evening
 
 For example, you are hugging a person you like - note in your head ""yeah, nice I would put this moment on the list tonight""","Yes, I may not really be able to influence the terrible situation in the world, perhaps globally now you can do little, but ...

 There are things that cannot be taken away from each of us:

 The opportunity to help others, the opportunity to create something, to enjoy emotional and physical contact with other people, to taste art (films, music, images, etc.) and many more things that can be the answer to the question “Why do I live?”","Create a mental image of the person you dislike the most.  See that he is sitting on a chair right in front of you.  Examine it in detail: hear the tone of voice, notice the mannerisms, the expression on the face.  Recall an incident from the past when this person really pissed you off.  Now try a nonjudgmental attitude.  Remember that he or she does not choose to be bad.  This man is doing the best he can, given
 his needs and awareness.  You find his behavior painful, but you can't blame him.  Like any other person, he lives as best he can, striving at a particular moment for the highest good.  This person cannot be someone they are not unless awareness changes.
 Yes, he may be doing something unpleasant for others, but will anyone feel better that we condemn him?  Maybe he needs a different approach?  Maybe he's not okay?",Intentions.  The speaker’s statement about what he is going to do and how, in connection with the fact that happened (for example, “I am going to”, “I will”, “I will not”, etc.),,," Forgive yourself.  To do this, say to yourself: “I did everything to correct the mistake.  And I will try not to repeat it in the future.  So I forgive myself and allow myself to move forward.”

 This point, psychologists say, despite its seeming formality, is no less important than the previous ones.  Guilt is subjective: we can continue to experience it even when other people have long since forgiven us.  Therefore, it is important to convince yourself that the situation is over, which means that there is no need to continue to scold yourself.",,,,,
" Just acknowledge your thoughts, let them go when the time comes, and get ready to meet new ones one by one.
 Keep doing this exercise until you feel that you have truly distanced yourself from your thoughts.  Do it until even evaluative thoughts begin to pass through the room without lingering.
