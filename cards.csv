During this exercise, you will observe the work of your consciousness, imagining that it is a white room through which thoughts pass.  You can perform it in any quiet place, sitting or lying down.  Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.  Breathe slowly and evenly throughout the exercise.,"So you're feeling anxious, maybe you're shaking. What can be done to make it easier:

0. Step aside (preferably not seen)",If a traumatic event occurred (an event that caused strong unpleasant experiences, violated a sense of security) for example
 Imagine that you are in a medium-sized white room with two doors.  Thoughts enter through one door and leave through another.  As soon as a thought appears, concentrate on it and try to categorize it as evaluative or non-evaluative (Example of an evaluative thought: “I will look stupid at tomorrow’s performance, they will laugh at me” / Example of a non-judgmental one: “I am afraid of tomorrow’s performance, how can I  anxious .. ”note by the author of the channel),Try to adjust your breathing (probably you are holding it from anxiety, pay attention), try to breathe deeply for 30-40 seconds
Consider each thought carefully, with curiosity and compassion until it goes away.  Don't try to analyze it, just note if it's evaluative or not.  Don't challenge it, don't try to believe or disbelieve in it.  Just be aware that this is a thought, a brief moment of your brain activity, an occasional visitor to your white room.," ""Hands-lashes"".  Try to make the body ""rubber"" as much as possible by bending over, lowering and relaxing your arms, neck, and torso.  Find the most comfortable position and swing"
Beware of thoughts that you have classified as evaluative.  They will try to take possession of you, to force you to accept the assessment.  The point of this exercise is to notice how “sticky” judgmental thoughts are—how they get stuck in your mind and how difficult it is to get rid of them.  You will determine that a thought is painful and judgmental by how long it stays in the white room, or by whether you begin to feel any emotion about it.," 4. The second most  important stage.  Slowly straighten up and shake well (when anxious, our body mobilizes and the body shakes. Tension. Usually people try to avoid this tremolo and cope with it. On the contrary, I propose to succumb to it and even strengthen it, give the body what it wants

 So you can feel more relaxed and calm in order to continue to cope with stress with your “head” 

 If it is not possible to complete this entire cycle, do one thing - what is most convenient now}",,"Study their biographies - see what difficulties they had to face in life, how they overcame them.

 What do you have in common?  What should be learned from them?  Doesn't this mean that, perhaps, everything is ahead of you?"," Try to build your own system for re-reading these entries - you can re-read every month and underline the most significant with a solid line, you can underline with a thick line every season, etc.

 When you constantly record these things and periodically return to this list, rereading it and highlighting the main thing, you are guaranteed to feel better."
 Try to constantly maintain even breathing, keep a clear image of the room and doors, follow thoughts and classify them.  Remember that a thought is just a thought.  You are much bigger than her.  You are the one who creates the white room through which thoughts are allowed to pass.  You have a million of them, they leave, but you still remain.  Thought does not require any action from you.  A thought does not oblige you to believe in it.  Thought is not you.,,
 Just watch them walk through the white room.  Let them live their short life and tell yourself that they have a right to exist, even estimated ones.,,, What do you have in common?  What should be learned from them?  Doesn't this mean that, perhaps, everything is ahead of you?
" Just acknowledge your thoughts, let them go when the time comes, and get ready to meet new ones one by one.
 Keep doing this exercise until you feel that you have truly distanced yourself from your thoughts.  Do it until even evaluative thoughts begin to pass through the room without lingering.

 P.S.  Instead of the image of a room with 2 doors, you can take an image that is closer to you:
 for example, a funicular that transfers thoughts or a baggage belt at an airport, etc.",,,,"If during the week you managed to notice at least one such thing a day in the moment, start noticing 2 a day

 Over time, a habit will form of noticing such things right in the moment, you will probably experience euphoria from this - how is it
 it is wonderful and exciting to be in such a moment “here and now”, your psyche will be grateful to you for this.","If you feel depressed, helpless, if you are scared and feel bad - think about where you can manifest yourself, whom you can help from the environment, how you can influence the future generation, with which of the people you like, you can mutually support each other  , what little things in life you can try / notice and enjoy it - look for your meaning, write it down, save up

 This will serve as an internal support.  Realize that in one way or another you can influence yourself and what is happening.  And can you!  Whatever situation you are in!",
